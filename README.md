# minimally

Minimal key-value store and event subscription

Inspired by <https://github.com/developit/mitt/>

-   **Microscopic:** weighs about 200 bytes gzipped
-   **Functional:** methods don't rely on `this`
-   **Great Name:** somehow [minimally](https://npm.im/minimally) wasn't taken

minimally was made for the browser, but works in any JavaScript runtime. It has no dependencies and supports IE9+.

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ npm install --save minimally
```

Then with a module bundler like [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), use as you would anything else:

```javascript
// using ES6 modules
import minimally from 'minimally'

// using CommonJS modules
var minimally = require('minimally')
```

The [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/minimally/dist/minimally.umd.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.minimally`.

## Usage

```js
import minimally from 'minimally'

const model = minimally()

// listen to an event
model.on('foo', e => console.log('foo', e) )

// Set value for key and dispatch event to subscribers
const val = { a: 'b' }
model.set('foo', val)

// Get value for key
m.get(key) === val

// working with handler references:
function onFoo() {}
model.on('foo', onFoo)   // listen
model.off('foo', onFoo)  // unlisten
```
